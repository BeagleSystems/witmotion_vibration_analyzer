# Witmotion Vibration Analysis

This project implements real-time vibration analysis using data from Witmotion Bluetooth devices. The analysis is performed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the time series data received from the device.

## Setup

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Witmotion SDK:
   - Download the Witmotion SDK from the official source
   - Follow the installation instructions provided with the SDK
